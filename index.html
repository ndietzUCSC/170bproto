    <h1>Prototype 2 - Norah Dietz</h1>
    <h2>How can EATING, T-SHIRTS, create a sense of CONFUSION.</h2>
    <p>I chose to to learn Armory3D, because a realtime engine attached 
        to Blender seems useful for grebox prototyping. 
        <br> Of course, an open source engine comes with stability 
        issues, which I repeatedly ran into. Otherwise, I found it very 
        intutive as a visual programming based engine.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>Build Info</h1>

            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>You run a pants store but are secretly selling unlicensed T-shirts.
                Uh oh... The inspectors just walked in.</p>
                
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Grab and eat the illicit T-shirts before the inspectors notice. 
                    <br> This is the only option. You must eat them.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>Use A and D move the left or right hand. Release to grab an item. <br>
                Make sure to click the game window at lease once, to enable sound.</p>
