    <h1>Prototype 2 - Norah Dietz</h1>
    <h2>How can EATING, T-SHIRTS, create a sense of CONFUSION.</h2>
    <p>I chose to learn Armory3D, because a real-time engine attached 
        to Blender seems useful for greybox prototyping. 
        <br> Of course, an open source engine comes with stability 
        issues, which I repeatedly ran into. Otherwise, I found it very 
        intuitive as a visual programming based engine.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>Build Info</h1>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>You run a pants store but are secretly selling unlicensed T-shirts.
                Uh oh... The inspectors just walked in.</p>
                
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Grab and eat the illicit T-shirts before the inspectors notice. 
                    <br> This is the only option. You must eat them.</p>
            
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>Use A and D to move the left or right hand. Release to grab an item. <br>
                Make sure to click the game window at least once to enable sound.</p>
            <h3>Known Bugs and Limitations</h3>
            <p>No scoring or fail states. <br> Mainly testing the hold and release control scheme.
                <br>Hands can get stuck/lose their correct origin.
                <br> Eating sfx will play repeatedly despite grabbed object disappearing.</p>
